# ðŸ”¥ Problem: Riot Threshold Model with Dunbar Limit
#
# Given a social graph (undirected) where each node represents a person
# and edges represent relationships (friends),
# each person has a threshold f(v) âˆˆ [0,1] (as a Fraction),
# which is the **minimum fraction of their neighbors** who must be rioting
# before they join the riot.
#
# Persons with f(v) = 0 riot immediately.
# Persons with f(v) > 1 never riot.
#
# The simulation runs until it reaches a stable point (no more new rioters).
#
# âž¤ Goal: return the total number of people who will end up rioting.
# âž¤ Constraints: Up to 25,000 people (N), but each person has few neighbors.
# âž¤ Complexity: O(N) or O(N log N)
