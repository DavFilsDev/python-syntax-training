# VARIABLES IN PYTHON
# Variables are containers used to store data values.
# You don't need to declare the type; Python infers it.

name = "Alice"       # string variable
age = 20             # integer variable
height = 1.65        # float variable
is_student = True    # boolean variable

# Printing values
print(name)
print(age)
print(height)
print(is_student)

# Reassigning variables
age = 21
print("Updated age:", age)

# IMPORTANT:
# - Variable names must start with a letter or underscore
# - They are case sensitive
# - They cannot start with a number or contain special characters
